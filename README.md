Covid-19 Vaccination Management System is the project that we decided to develop for the Software Project Management module. There are four major functions/ management systems combined to develop the system. Person Management System, Doctor Management System, Nurse Management System, and Vaccine Management System are the four major functions in this system. The main purpose of Vaccination Management System is to store and keep the records of all the details of people who are expecting to get vaccines, doctors, nurses, and vaccines who will be involving with Covid-19 vaccination programs in an unambiguous way.
